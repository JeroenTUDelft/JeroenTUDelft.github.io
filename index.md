This report outlines the design process for a new computationally designed multipurpose apartment building in the heart of Rotterdam. We begin by defining the user scenarios and explaining the theory behind the design choices made for these scenarios. Next, we discuss the development of the building's components and layout. Following this, we will go into further detail about the process of transforming the massing model into a fully realized structure. The report will then cover the design of the surrounding environment, concluding with an overview of how the building was textured and visualized.

## Task

The project brief calls for a mixed-use computationally designed building that integrates with the surrounding area. The primary function will be housing for three target groups: students, elderly, and starters. Each group’s housing needs are outlined below, along with other requirements, wich combined should result in achiving the primary goal to account for more personel interaction between the different usergroups.

Housing Requirements:

- Student Units: Min. 400 units, either self-contained studios (min. 25m²) or shared units (min. 25m² per student).
- Elderly Units: Min. 200 units, sized 50-80m², with a mix of independent and assisted living. Assisted units must be accessible and include a private outdoor space (min. 5m²).
- Starter Units: Min. 200 units for couples or small families.

Additional Requirements:

- Parking: 1.33 bike spots and 0.8 car spots per dwelling. Secure parking for residents and public parking for additional spaces.
- Green Spaces: Design to incorporate greenery equal to the plot's surface area (~8,000m²). Consider green roofs, vertical façades, and stepped terraces.
- Rainwater Harvesting: System to collect and store rainwater for reuse within the building and potentially the neighborhood.
- Solar Power: Sufficient capacity to power public lighting in the complex.
- Social Control: Public spaces visible from residents' dwellings to encourage safety and interaction.

Design Goals:

- Minimize sunlight blockage and noise for neighboring buildings.
- Maximize social integration and maintain a balance between privacy and community.
- Preserve the Biergarten.
- Ensure truck access at the back of Schieblok.

## General overview of proces

To give a general insight of the designproces the following flow chart is made. Every element of the design proces is considered in the comming chapters of this webpage.

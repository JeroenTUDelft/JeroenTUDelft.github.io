This report outlines the design process for a new computationally designed multipurpose apartment building in the heart of Rotterdam. We begin by defining the user scenarios and explaining the theory behind the design choices made for these scenarios. Next, we discuss the development of the building's components and layout. Following this, we will go into further detail about the process of transforming the massing model into a fully realized structure. The report will then cover the design of the surrounding environment, concluding with an overview of how the building was textured and visualized.

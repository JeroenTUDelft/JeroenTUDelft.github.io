Water balance
The table bellow illustrates the water balance calculations for the Schieblock project based on a collection surface of 6900 meters squared, average flushing (toilet water) for 860 people and Dutch rainfall data. Our goal was to have the collection ability to be toilet-water autonomous for 31-days. This is to say, to be able not to rely on net-water for the building's toilets for an extent of a month, if this collection capacity can be fulfilled based on oscillations in average yearly rainfall. For such we would need 21 voxels for toilet-water collection.

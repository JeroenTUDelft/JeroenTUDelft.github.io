## Water and Energy Calculations consists of:
1. Water calculation
2. Solar panel calculation


## 1. Water calculation

Water balance
The table bellow illustrates the water balance calculations for the Schieblock project based on a collection surface of 6900 meters squared, average flushing (toilet water) for 860 people and Dutch rainfall data. Our goal was to have the collection ability to be toilet-water autonomous for 31-days. This is to say, to be able not to rely on net-water for the building's toilets for an extent of a month, if this collection capacity can be fulfilled based on oscillations in average yearly rainfall. For such we would need 21 voxels for toilet-water collection.

## 2. Solar panel calculation

To calculate the space needed for the solarpanels, the demand of power needs to be calculated first. 

- Library / Coffee corner : 500 lux * 630 m2 =  315.000 lumens​
- Roof garden / shared gardens : 200 lux * 3600 m2 = 720.000 lumens​
- Laundry rooms : 300 lux * 180 m2 = 54.000 lumens​
- Shared kitchen / living rooms : 200 lux * 4950 m2 = 990.000 lumens​

Total = 2.079.000 lumens​

​For LED lighting the demanded power : P =  lm / 100

2.079.000 / 100 = 20,79 kW​

Assuming lights are on for 12 hours per day & 365 days per year.  ​

The yearly demand of energie to power 100% of lights of communal areas : 20,79 * 365 * 12 = 91.060,2 kWh ​

An average solar panel (1,94 m2) makes 327 kWh per year, which equals 169 kWh/ m2.​

91.060,2 / 169 = 538,8 m2     ​

538,8 m2 of the roof surface is needed for solar panels​.

Due to the limited amount of time, knowledge and expertise we had for the project, our final building has got some limitations. These limitations can be seen as future design opportunities. We will discuss them here. 

If we had more time to do more extensive research at the start of the project, we would dive deeper into the context of our site. The Schieblock is a very diverse site with many functions and features. To really implement the Schieblock and the people already existing there into account, we should have done more research. This would ultimately change the shape of our building, the appearance of our facade and the functions and features that our building has. For future design opportunities, the implementation of the Schieblock can be improved by doing more thorough research on the site. 

During the trial of our growing algorithm, we had a lot of difficulties with getting the functions in the right place. Due to a lack of time and knowledge we were not able to do more specific analysis to have more power over the placement of the functions. This would for example result in a more evenly distributed roof garden on the roof, a lobby that is single level and a communal library / coffee corner that has a great view on the roof garden with a lot of incoming light from the south. 

After finishing the growing algorithm, we did not have enough time to create more logically placed rooms by adjusting the grown functions. The sections we created now, roughly represent the outcome of the growing algorithm (we made slight adaptations). However, if we were to make more detailed floor plans where we define each room, we would have to make a lot more adaptations to really create a space people want to live in. This is where technology meets the human side. It shows that a building cannot be completely procedurally generated. For future design opportunities, it would be interesting to see how our building can be positively improved after more human influence. 

Finally, we want to end positive. After having some difficulties finding our way into the project and missing knowledge in the computer science sector, we are extremely satisfied with the result we all worked so hard for.

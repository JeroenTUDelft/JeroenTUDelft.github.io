## Voxelsize
We based our voxel size on the question of what is the “minimum liveable space”?.  
Author and designer Bruno Munari provides an interesting reflection on the traditional Japanese house as follows: 
“The proportions of the rooms are expressed in tatami: [a mat of fine and tightly woven straw […] its size about three foot by six [91*182cm], the size of a man lying down.], so that a two-tatami room is about six foot by six [182*182cm], an eight-tatami room is twelve by twelve [366*366] and so on. […] The rooms are about eight feet [244cm] high, so that when one lies in bed there is not a great yawning void above one.”1, which we used and adjusted to Dutch upper median (average height of men in upper median in 2020 above 19 year’s old, 194cm tall), and further standardized to arrive at a three-by-three-by-three meter voxel.

## Bubble diagram
### Proces

Bubble diagrams
Our initial hand drawn bubble diagrams, illustrating the distribution of the space and functions can be appreciated as follows.

We furthermore developed a simple code to illustrate in two-dimensions the relationship between functions and their connections. 

Figure 1 shows how a bubble diagram can be used to illustrate connections (lines) between the different spaces (nodes). The size of the nodes can be used to represent the actual size of the space or the relative importance of the given space. The importance of each line, i.e.: the importance of the connection between the two spaces, can also be adjusted and the configuration/shape of the diagram will be respectfully a changed. This can be observed between Figure 2: Bubble Diagram Schieblok Ground Floor-Configuration 1 and Figure 3: Bubble Diagram Schieblok Ground Floor-Configuration 2, where the configuration of the diagram and shape is dependant on the independent variable line or “importance of connection”. In the first figure variable line is equal between “Lobby” and the three street access points: “Delftseplein/Schiestraat”, “Delftsehof” and “Schiekade”, whilst in Figure 3 variable line is equal to 1 between “Lobby” and “Delftseplein/Schiestraat” and 0.1 between the two other street access points. You can see how this affect the disposition ad arrangement of not only the concerned nodes, but of all the nodes in the network.

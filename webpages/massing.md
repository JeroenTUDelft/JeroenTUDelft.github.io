## Criteria
List of criteria in order of hierarchy and respective quantification: define 

1. closeness_perimeter: minimize horizontal distance from function to perimeter/fa√ßade.
2. need_sunlight: maximize number of sun ray hits for function.
3. need_view: maximize number of hits to view surface for function.
4. less_noise: maximize euclidean distance from noise point to function: bier garden (<euclidean_distance: noise_point).
5. closeness_gf: minimize vertical distance from function to Ground Floor.
6. closeness_ug: minimize vertical distance from function to Underground.
7. closeness_r: minimize vertical distance from function to Roof.
8. closeness_schiestraat: minimize horizontal distance from function to Schiestraat.
9. closeness_schiekade: minimize vertical distance from function to Schiekade.
10. a_lift_shaft/stairs: minimize horizontal distance from Lift Shaft/Stairs to function.
11. wind_pollution: minimize wind pollution by rule of thumb: height of building should not exceed twice the width and/or it should be smaller than two times the height of surrounding buildings.
12. far_sc_elderly_unit: maximize euclidean distance from function Self-Contained Elderly Unit.
13. far_assisted_living_elderly_unit: maximize euclidean distance from function Assisted-Living Elderly Unit.
14. a_shared_kitchen/livingroom: minimize horizontal distance from Shared Kitchen/Living Room (floor-shared) to function.
15. a_laundryroom: minimize horizontal distance from Laundry Room to function.
16. a_carecentre: minimize horizontal distance from Care Centre to function.

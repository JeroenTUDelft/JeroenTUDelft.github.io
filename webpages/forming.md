## Design principles
Design Principles order of hierarchy [requirement]
1. Leaning into “golden view”:
   - Progressive displacement towards “golden view”.
2. Focus on communal and green/exterior space:
   - a. Roof Garden/planter placement:
      - i. to increase biodiversity
      - ii. ensure a green area equal to total surface,
      - iii. collection of for one month water autonomy: garden irrigation and toilet water.
   - b. Balcony placement per living unit:
      - i. optimize sunlight and
      - ii. maximize unit-to-unit privacy.
   - c. Designation of 20% of building area to communal space, promoting interaction among residents, in the creation of:
      - i. a Communal Library/Coffee Corner 
      - ii. practical areas, such as a grocery Store, laundry room(s) and a care centre
      - iii. a Shared Kitchen/Livingroom on every floor.
   - d. Strategic placement:
      - i. of communal and or public facilities to facilitate and promote access 
      - ii. of living units, to promote integration and prevent possible discomfort/nuisance between groups or external conditions (i.e.: elderly separated from students, elderly away from biergarten)
3. Integrating with surrounding buildings/context by:
   - a. ensuring a minimum of 2 hours of sunlight to surrounding buildings, based on sun-path calculations and building heights,
   - b. minimising wind pollution: (rule of thumb) setting maximum height less than double the height of surrounding buildings,
   - c. building typology/rules:
      - i. high plint (can be for example 7m high)
      - ii. big windows,
      - iii. structured rhythmic façade,
      - iv. building structure: big columns and arches (mainly visible from ground floor).
4. Powering of communal area lighting up to 100% through the installation of solar panels.

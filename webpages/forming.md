## Design principles

Our design of the Schieblock proposal stemmed from three main branches: a focus on communal and green/exterior space, an integration with surrounding buildings/context, and a leaning into the "golden view". 

The flowchart bellow illustrates how the before mentioned design principles were integrated with the programme of requirements of the project.

### Design principle: Focus on communal & green/exterior space
We incorporated green and exterior space by means of garden and planter placements in the inner cave and roof of the building. Additionally, variations of balcony types (based on orientation and resident-type), were assigned per living-unit, maximizing the possibility of contact with the exterior and greenery that is often a challenge in multi-story development projects.

### Design principle: Integrating with surrounding buildings/context
A sunlight analysis was carried out to investigate the possible effect on sunlight to existing buildings based on the shape and size of the Schieblock project.  Ensuring a minimum of two hours of sunlight, our building mass (voxel cloud) was hollowed to create a cave/hole in the mass from north to east, meeting this minimum requirement. This is turn created the possibility for additional surface area for greenery and exterior space mentioned above. 
Additionally, based on the soundscape of the location and taking the railroad (north by northwest) and hospitality venues, the Biergarten and Annabel (southeast) as the mayor noise sources, a noise analysis was carried out in order to make informed-decision about the ideal allocation of the different resident-types. We set the highest priority to the elderly resident-type.

### Design principle: Leaning into “golden view”
The north by northwest is the only "unobstructed" view at the Schieblock.  We wanted to exploit and  prioritize this view, the location being surrounded and packed with other buildings and visuals. This was done with a simple "leaning" of building towards this view (already not uncommon in the Dutch 'cityscape' with moving foundations).

## Sections
After the Growing Algorithm placed every function in it's desired place in the building - shown in the animation on the massing page - the file stil consisted of a few loose voxels with badly placed functions. For instance assigning a single voxel with a elderly dorm function whilst it's surrounded by voxels with a different function. To make sure the building has a logical distribution of functions we manually scanned the sections of the grown voxelcloud and worked away as much 'rough edges' as possible. The result of this is shown below.

To give a clearer and more realistic view of the building, we added these textured floorplans and sections. In the first image you see a detailed floorplan of the communal library and roofgarden. In this case furniture, trees, doors & windows and people were added to give a clearer and more realistic view of the possible layout of the space. The next image shows a more detailed section of the 23rd column of grown voxels. Here stares, elevatorshafts and cars have been added. The final iamage shows a general 'birds eye'-view of the building in the surrounding area.

## Tiles

A total of eleven tiles were used to clad the façade points of our resulting cloud, based on our three-by-three-by-three meter voxel.  The tiles were designed and applied based on floor level, orientation and function. Window one was designed as a high window tile, to be applied to the "carpark" function. The extended wall space allowed for green façade placement. Windows two was applied uniquely at the north and west façade and never at the ground floor, whilst windows three, four and five, being smaller windows were applied at the south and east, hotter sides of our buildings. A similar condition was used for our balcony tiles, placing "balcony wide solar" only on the south and east façades. "Balcony wide" was prioritized for our elderly-dwellers.

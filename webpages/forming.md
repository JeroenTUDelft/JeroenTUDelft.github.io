## Design principles

Our design of the Schieblock proposal stemmed from three main branches: a focus on communal and green/exterior space, an integration with surrounding buildings/context, and a leaning into the "golden view". 


The flowchart bellow illustrates how the before mentioned design principles were integrated with the programme of requirements of the project.

### Design principle: Focus on communal & green/exterior space
We incorporated green and exterior space by means of garden and planter placements in the inner cave and roof of the building. Additionally, variations of balcony types (based on orientation and resident-type), were assigned per living-unit, maximizing the possibility of contact with the exterior and greenery that is often a challenge in multi-story development projects.

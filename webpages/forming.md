## 1. Design principles

Our design of the Schieblock proposal stemmed from three main branches: a focus on communal and green/exterior space, an integration with surrounding buildings/context, and a leaning into the "golden view". 

The flowchart bellow illustrates how the before mentioned design principles were integrated with the programme of requirements of the project.

### Design principle: Focus on communal & green/exterior space
We incorporated green and exterior space by means of garden and planter placements in the inner cave and roof of the building. Additionally, variations of balcony types (based on orientation and resident-type), were assigned per living-unit, maximizing the possibility of contact with the exterior and greenery that is often a challenge in multi-story development projects.

### Design principle: Integrating with surrounding buildings/context
A sunlight analysis was carried out to investigate the possible effect on sunlight to existing buildings based on the shape and size of the Schieblock project.  Ensuring a minimum of two hours of sunlight, our building mass (voxel cloud) was hollowed to create a cave/hole in the mass from north to east, meeting this minimum requirement. This is turn created the possibility for additional surface area for greenery and exterior space mentioned above. 
Additionally, based on the soundscape of the location and taking the railroad (north by northwest) and hospitality venues, the Biergarten and Annabel (southeast) as the mayor noise sources, a noise analysis was carried out in order to make informed-decision about the ideal allocation of the different resident-types. We set the highest priority to the elderly resident-type.

### Design principle: Leaning into “golden view”
The north by northwest is the only "unobstructed" view at the Schieblock.  We wanted to exploit and  prioritize this view, the location being surrounded and packed with other buildings and visuals. This was done with a simple "leaning" of building towards this view (already not uncommon in the Dutch 'cityscape' with moving foundations).

## 2. Sections

### Schematized sections
After the Growing Algorithm successfully allocated each function to its designated location within the building — shown in the animation on the massing page — the resulting file still contained a few misaligned voxels with poorly assigned functions. For example, some voxels intended for specific functions, such as an elderly dormitory, were positioned next to voxels designated for entirely different uses. To ensure a more logical distribution of functions, we manually reviewed the sections of the grwon voxelcloud and refined the layout, addressing inconsistencies and removing "rough edges" to a certain extent. The final, optimized result is found below.

### Detailed sections
To provide a clearer and more realistic representation of the building, we’ve included textured floorplans and sections. The first image features a detailed floorplan of the communal library and rooftop garden, with furniture, trees, doors, windows, and people added to offer a more accurate sense of the space’s layout. The second image present a section of the 23rd column of the grown voxelcloud, incorporating elements such as stairs, elevator shafts, and cars. The final image shows a bird's-eye view of the building in its surrounding area, giving a more detailed view by adding the layout of the roofgarden and distribution of solarpanels.

## 3. Tiles

### Forming tiles

A total of eleven tiles were used to clad the façade points of our resulting cloud, based on our three-by-three-by-three meter voxel.  The tiles were designed and applied based on floor level, orientation and function. Window one was designed as a high window tile, to be applied to the "carpark" function. The extended wall space allowed for green façade placement. Window two was applied uniquely at the north and west façade and never at the ground floor, whilst windows three, four and five, being smaller windows were applied at the south and east, hotter sides of our buildings. A similar condition was used for our balcony tiles, placing "balcony wide solar" only on the south and east façades. "Balcony wide" was prioritized for our elderly-dwellers.

### Placing tiles

For the placement of the façade tiles, we created a program in Houdini that first finds all façade voxels (outside voxels) of the imported ‘function assigned voxel cloud’. To make for a dynamic and well-thought-out façade, we also introduced some if statements for the making of new functions. These systems give us the following necessary outputs; 
-	Entrances for communal areas and parking
-	Green roof in the hole of the building
-	Dynamic array of balconies, whilst also making sure we don’t have too many or too few balconies

Then it’s a matter of assigning each function to their specific tile, also accounting for the façade's orientation. The result is a beautiful dynamic façade, that works optimally for the comfortability of functions, taking sunlight into account and also the necessary placement of tiles with solar panels.

## 4. Renders

The tiles form the last part of the design of Rotterdam's Golden view. To give a more realistic view of the project we rendered the building with these images as a result.

The final design follows the requirements stated on the home page. The target for the amount of housing units and additional requirements is achieved. 

Rotterdam's Golden View minimizes sunlight blockage and noise for buildings in the surrounding area by incorporating the blocking- and sound analysis for the voxelcloud. This results in the open area half way - up the building. It maximizes social integration by adding a communal library and shared laundryrooms. The biergarten is preserved because the voxelcloud does not cover that area. Because of the use of multiple accessroads the building is still accesseble by truck or ambulance.

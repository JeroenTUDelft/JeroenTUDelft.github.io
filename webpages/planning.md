## The planning phase consists of:
1. Users
   - User scenarios per group
   - Usage
   - REL-Chart
2. Site analysis
3. List of facilities & spaces

## Users
### User scenarios per group  

![minor self contained student](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67cedbe7-c028-4736-b0cb-f9a77493f722)

Self-contained student units: as a student in a self-contained dwelling, I will have at least 25m2 of space with a private bathroom and kitchen. I will have access to other facilities including a shared laundry-room, bicycle-storage and building-shared spaces: shared library/livingroom/playroom and garden. This will allow me to interact and spend time with other fellow residents when I want.  


![minor shared student](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7f1c505-a586-451b-898f-11b2ec031842)

Shared student units: as a student in a multi-dwelling, I will have a room of at least 25m2  of space, sharing a bathroom, kitchen and living room with up to eight fellow resident-students. This type of setup will allow me to have my privacy whilst sharing and having the chance to interact with my fellow unit-mates in the kitchen and living room, now that spaces less than 25m2 can be a bit too small. Additionally I will have access to a shared bicycle-storage and building-shared spaces: shared library/livingroom/playroom and garden.  


![minor assisted elderly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9538f52b-37ca-4a12-93dd-32eeeed5b47a)

Assisted-elderly units: As an assisted-elderly, my dwelling will have to be very accessible/ linked to the care centre. I want my dwelling to be easily accessible by elevator and accessed while using my wheelchair. If necessary I don't want to use the stairs, therefore the dwelling must be single-level and preferably on the lower floors of the building. The dwelling does not have to be too big, however a minimum area of 50m2 is required. I enjoy my peace and quiet, thus I would want for my dwelling to be further away from noisy areas and neighbours. Finally, I enjoy spending time outside and growing plants in my garden, so I would like to have an outside garden with sunlight. 

![minor self contained elderly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/def832ad-4652-4aed-90d2-56548c59aace)

Self-contained elderly units: as an independent senior, I want a parking spot and a storage unit to keep my extra stuff. After parking my car, I want the elevator to be accessible to get to my dwelling. The dwelling itself could be at least 50m2 and the level does not matter, as long as it is not too close to the Biergarten. I like my rest. However, I also enjoy conversations with my neighbours to make my ordinary life slightly more interesting. I love chatting in the hallways and getting a coffee when I have some spare time. Furthermore, I want the laundry room and the grocery store to be quite close to my dwelling, so I don’t have to carry heavy stuff for a long way. The library, the living room and the garden do not necessarily have to be as close to my dwelling, since I like to take a walk and enjoy these relaxing bits of the day. 

![minor starter units](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37bfff08-3009-4488-a15a-611177515772)

Starter units: as a starter, I want my family to feel as safe as possible and make our lives more convenient. This means that our apartment must at least be 50 m2 with some extra storage space and a balcony included. The extra storage space doesn’t need to be on our floor.  As starters my partner and I are ambitious and very busy. A room for a potential child is not necessary because we don’t want to have our child growing up in a large building with students. We like our rest and privacy but  don’t want to feel like we’re living alone. Some casual contact between the other residents is what we like. So the possibility to chat with the students or help the elderly in a communal area would be nice. As long as we can park our car in a carpark that’s in direct contact with the building itself by stares or an elevator. As our lives are busy, we want the facilities ( coffee corner, supermarket, laundry units and communal area ) to be nearby. We don’t want to be disturbed by the chaos that’s brought by the students. 

### Usage

## Site Analysis

![restaurants](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a9647ca-d9e8-43f2-973b-e054fce50a97)

Figure 4 :
We chose to not add a restaurant, since there are plenty of restaurants in the neighbourhood.


![accessibility](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a83c8acb-9ba0-4623-9255-2abfde5cdf30)

Figure 5 : 

The Schieblock is also located near lots of public transportation stops. This creates various possibilities of entrance placement, keeping the dependent elderly and minimum walking distance in mind.


![gyms](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/984b5860-e180-47a4-bb34-02d4dcd904c3)

Figure 6 : 
The Schieblock is located among various gyms and other sportscentres, which lead us to the decision to not add a gym in our building.


![grocerystores](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc39fa4f-90b4-482c-9a07-ff0a90d4e1f1)

Figure 7 : 

The supermarkets are relatively close to the Schieblock. However, for the dependent elderly, they could be quite far away if they go by foot. We chose to add a small supermarket in our building for the daily groceries, to make our building more accessible. Not only for the dependent elderly, but also for other residents that need some extra groceries


![libraries](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc8ab859-0e7e-40bb-ae26-7461e687988a)

Figure 8 : 

As you can see here, there are only 2 libraries near the Schieblock and they are still quite far away. We chose to add a library with coffee corner to our building to increase interaction among all residents (young and old) and to make it easier to enjoy a good book. This can be a great moment of rest or a motivator to study.

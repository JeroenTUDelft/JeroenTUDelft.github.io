## The planning phase consists of:
1. User scenarios per group
2. Site analysis
3. List of facilities & spaces
4. Usage
5. REL-chart


## 1. User scenarios per group 

To make sure that every user is as satisfied with the eventual building as possible, we thought about the scenarios that they encounter on a daily basis. From this we were able to find-out what they require from an apartment building. 

![minor self contained student](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67cedbe7-c028-4736-b0cb-f9a77493f722)

Self-contained student units: as a student in a self-contained dwelling, I will have at least 25m2 of space with a private bathroom and kitchen. I will have access to other facilities including a shared laundry-room, bicycle-storage and building-shared spaces: shared library/livingroom/playroom and garden. This will allow me to interact and spend time with other fellow residents when I want.  


![minor shared student](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7f1c505-a586-451b-898f-11b2ec031842)

Shared student units: as a student in a multi-dwelling, I will have a room of at least 25m2  of space, sharing a bathroom, kitchen and living room with up to eight fellow resident-students. This type of setup will allow me to have my privacy whilst sharing and having the chance to interact with my fellow unit-mates in the kitchen and living room, now that spaces less than 25m2 can be a bit too small. Additionally I will have access to a shared bicycle-storage and building-shared spaces: shared library/livingroom/playroom and garden.  


![minor assisted elderly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9538f52b-37ca-4a12-93dd-32eeeed5b47a)

Assisted-elderly units: As an assisted-elderly, my dwelling will have to be very accessible/ linked to the care centre. I want my dwelling to be easily accessible by elevator and accessed while using my wheelchair. If necessary I don't want to use the stairs, therefore the dwelling must be single-level and preferably on the lower floors of the building. The dwelling does not have to be too big, however a minimum area of 50m2 is required. I enjoy my peace and quiet, thus I would want for my dwelling to be further away from noisy areas and neighbours. Finally, I enjoy spending time outside and growing plants in my garden, so I would like to have an outside garden with sunlight. 

![minor self contained elderly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/def832ad-4652-4aed-90d2-56548c59aace)

Self-contained elderly units: as an independent senior, I want a parking spot and a storage unit to keep my extra stuff. After parking my car, I want the elevator to be accessible to get to my dwelling. The dwelling itself could be at least 50m2 and the level does not matter, as long as it is not too close to the Biergarten. I like my rest. However, I also enjoy conversations with my neighbours to make my ordinary life slightly more interesting. I love chatting in the hallways and getting a coffee when I have some spare time. Furthermore, I want the laundry room and the grocery store to be quite close to my dwelling, so I don’t have to carry heavy stuff for a long way. The library, the living room and the garden do not necessarily have to be as close to my dwelling, since I like to take a walk and enjoy these relaxing bits of the day. 

![minor starter units](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37bfff08-3009-4488-a15a-611177515772)

Starter units: as a starter, I want my family to feel as safe as possible and make our lives more convenient. This means that our apartment must at least be 50 m2 with some extra storage space and a balcony included. The extra storage space doesn’t need to be on our floor.  As starters my partner and I are ambitious and very busy. A room for a potential child is not necessary because we don’t want to have our child growing up in a large building with students. We like our rest and privacy but  don’t want to feel like we’re living alone. Some casual contact between the other residents is what we like. So the possibility to chat with the students or help the elderly in a communal area would be nice. As long as we can park our car in a carpark that’s in direct contact with the building itself by stares or an elevator. As our lives are busy, we want the facilities ( coffee corner, supermarket, laundry units and communal area ) to be nearby. We don’t want to be disturbed by the chaos that’s brought by the students. 


## 2. Site Analysis

Since the building has to encourage possitive interaction between the groups and satisfy the needs of its users, a site analysis was done to find out what kind of facilities the building would need. To do so we visited the site itself and done research online.

![restaurants](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a9647ca-d9e8-43f2-973b-e054fce50a97)

Figure 1 : Screenshot form google maps showing all the restaurants in the surrounding area.

We chose to not add a restaurant, since there are plenty of restaurants in the neighbourhood.


![accessibility](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a83c8acb-9ba0-4623-9255-2abfde5cdf30)

Figure 2 : Screenshot form google maps showing all the public transport acces points in the surrounding area.

The Schieblock is also located near lots of public transportation stops. This creates various possibilities of entrance placement, keeping the dependent elderly and minimum walking distance in mind.


![gyms](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/984b5860-e180-47a4-bb34-02d4dcd904c3)

Figure 3 : Screenshot form google maps showing all the gyms in the surrounding area.

The Schieblock is located among various gyms and other sportscentres, which lead us to the decision to not add a gym in our building.


![grocerystores](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc39fa4f-90b4-482c-9a07-ff0a90d4e1f1)

Figure 4 : Screenshot form google maps showing all the grocerystores in the surrounding area.

The supermarkets are relatively close to the Schieblock. However, for the dependent elderly, they could be quite far away if they go by foot. We chose to add a small supermarket in our building for the daily groceries, to make our building more accessible. Not only for the dependent elderly, but also for other residents that need some extra groceries


![libraries](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc8ab859-0e7e-40bb-ae26-7461e687988a)

Figure 5 : Screenshot form google maps showing all the libraries in the surrounding area.

As you can see here, there are only 2 libraries near the Schieblock and they are still quite far away. We chose to add a library with coffee corner to our building to increase interaction among all residents (young and old) and to make it easier to enjoy a good book. This can be a great moment of rest or a motivator to study.



## 3. List of facilities & spaces

Concluding the site analysis and the user scenarios we were able to build a list of facilities and spaces. Added to every function is a rough estimation of the desired square meters for the specific function. These were basic calculations on averages of allready excisiting data. For instance the carpark: the amount of square meters for an average parkingspace multiplied by the minimal amount of spaces needed for this building.

1. Lobby: 100m2 
2. Carpark: 4000m2 
3. Grocery Store: 300m2
4. Bicycle Storage: 250m2
5. Communal Library/Coffee Corner: 600m2
6. Care Centre: 153m2
7. Shared Kitchen/Living Room (floor-shared): 5000m2

   - Balcony 
10. Self-Contained Starter Unit (single-level): 7000m2 
    - Living room/kitchen
    - Bedroom
    - Bathroom

21. Lift Shaft/Stairs 

## 4. Usage

To quantify the needs of the different user groups, multiple tables were made. These are displayed below.

In the table below the relation between every user group and every function is displayed. The higher the number listed, the more important we recon the relation to be for that specific user. The relations are listed between 0 and 1 with 0 meaning the function is not important to the user and 1 meaning the function is absolutely necessary.

Figure 6  : Table ussage per user group


From this table we were able to construct the following matrix in wich the importance between every function is listed. With dark blue meaning the relation is very important and light blue meaning the realtion is not important. This table is a representation of how close the functions should be placed between eachother in the building itself.

Figure 7 : Table relation between functions

From this table we were able to construct the REL-Chart wich represents the adjecency between the functions. This means that if the relation between the function is important they should be placed close to each other. As an example : the elderly units are not to be placed close to the student-units because of the noise. However, they would like to live closer to an elevator so they don't have to walk a great distance to leave the building. The distribution of relations is displayed in the legenda next to the figure.
